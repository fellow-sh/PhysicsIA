# Force of B Field of a Current-enduced Wire

This IA investigates Lorentz force, specifically on how force relates to current induced in a wire.
There were a number of challenges in implementing a feasible experiment, in part because there were a number of variables that were not taken into account.

There are two experiments in this repository.
The first experiment tested the relationship between repulsive force between a current-carrying wire and a series of neodymium magnets.
This experiment failed to relate to Lorentz force as it did not adhere to its principle.
The second experiment measured the deflection angle of a wire on a pendulum to identify the amount of force exerted with respect to current.
This experiment is what is explored in this IA.

Interesting read, 10/10, would recommend!
