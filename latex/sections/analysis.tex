\section*{Discussion}

While the points on Figure \ref{fig:procplot} are visibly correlated and have a strong correlation coefficient with the plotted regression, the shape of the points suggests the current induced in the wire and the force measured are not linearly related.
Given that the random error is too small to result in meaningful differences, this means that either there exists systematic error in the experiment, or the hypothesis that current is linearly related to force is incorrect.
