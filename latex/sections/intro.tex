\section{Introduction}

As the world transitions from internal combustion engines to electric motors, I have begun to wonder how exactly electricity is used in vehicles.
More specifically, how electrical force is transformed into physical force.
Having worked with DC motors for small projects when I was younger, all I understood was that electricity made these motors spin.
Now, with a basic understanding of Lorentz force, I want to explore this concept again and investigate how current relates to physical force.
