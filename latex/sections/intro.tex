\section{Introduction}

As the world transitions from internal combustion engines to electric motors, I have begun to wonder how exactly electricity is used in vehicles.
More specifically, how electrical energy is transformed into kinetic energy.
Having worked with DC motors for small projects when I was younger, the most I understood was that, when electricity flowed through the DC motor, it would spin.
Now, with a more comprehensive understanding of magnetism, I'm curious to know just how electricity is used to create force.
